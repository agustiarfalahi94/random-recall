## [Unreleased] — feature/onboarding-ui-polish

### Added
- Onboarding notification page now matches the settings screen exactly:
  Daily / Weekdays / Weekends preset chips, individual square day chips,
  and time picker rows with sun/moon icon containers
- Active days section visible regardless of Anytime vs Set time range selection
- "Skip for now — enable notifications later" button on the notification
  onboarding page when permission is denied, so users are never stuck

### Fixed
- **Critical** — Onboarding resets to page 1 after returning from Android
  notification settings: question/answer/category and current page are now
  saved to SharedPreferences as a draft, so if Android kills the app process
  while the user is in Settings the app restores to page 3 on restart
- Practice Now sessions no longer affect score history or streak
- Test notification (Send test notification in settings) no longer records
  a score entry or counts toward streak
- End time validation bug: start 1:12 PM + end 1:15 PM (same hour) now
  correctly shows "End time must be at least 1 hour after start time"
- Category dropdown in Add Question no longer shows locked/dimmed items

### Changed
- Free plan category use limit removed — questions can be added to any
  category freely (only the 1 custom category creation limit remains)
- Free plan note in Manage Categories updated to reflect accurate limits

### Removed
- `freeCategoryLimit`, `getCategoryLimit()`, `canUseCategory()` from PlanService
- Locked dropdown item logic in Add Question screen

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-02 · feature/free-limits → develop → main

### Added
- **Category management screen** — create custom categories with an emoji
  picker, rename, delete (if no questions attached)
- Default categories (General, Work) are locked and hidden from
  management screen; identified via `is_default` DB column (migration v3)
- **Challenge Mode** — timer ≤ 20s activates streak tracking and bonus
  question slots; dynamic fire emoji display (1 dimmed / 1 / 3 large)
- Timer challenge card on home screen taps through to notification settings,
  auto-scrolling to the timer section
- FAB redesigned as single "+" that opens an add-menu bottom sheet with
  "New Question" and "New Category" options
- Post-settings permission check: spinner + "Checking notification
  permission…" text while verifying on return from Android settings
- `WidgetsBindingObserver` in onboarding notification page so permission
  is re-checked only when the user actually returns to the app (not when
  Settings opens)

### Fixed
- **Critical** — Notifications never delivered: `tz.local` was defaulting
  to UTC because `setLocalLocation()` was never called; added
  `flutter_timezone` package and set correct device timezone on init
- **Critical** — `AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle` silently failed
  on Android 12+ without the special "Alarms & Reminders" user grant;
  switched to `inexactAllowWhileIdle` (no special permission needed)
- Notification permission "Try again" did nothing: `AppSettings.openAppSettings()`
  resolves its Future immediately when Settings opens, not when user returns;
  fixed with `WidgetsBindingObserver.didChangeAppLifecycleState`
- Onboarding overflow by ~25px on Xiaomi 15: moved animation wrappers
  (FadeTransition/SlideTransition) outside SingleChildScrollView
- Feature chips overflow on welcome page: Row → Wrap
- `use_build_context_synchronously` warning in Add Question after async gap

### Changed
- App package renamed `com.example.random_recall` → `com.inkpebble.randomrecall`
- Challenge threshold: only timers ≤ 20s count for streak/bonus (not 90s)
- DB version bumped to 3; `is_default` column added to categories table
- Category seeding reduced to 2 defaults (General + Work)
- Free plan: 1 custom category creation limit (`freeMaxCustomCategories = 1`)
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` / `USE_EXACT_ALARM` removed from AndroidManifest

### Removed
- "+ Category" chip from question list filter row

---

## [1.0.3] — feature/notification-schedule

### Added
- Notification schedule settings screen with time window, frequency slider,
  active days picker with Daily / Weekdays / Weekends presets
- 7-day fresh notification scheduling (one-time slots, no repeating alarms)
- Response timer slider (0–90s in 5s steps) in notification settings
- Streak tracking: 7-day consecutive challenge streak earns +1 question slot
- Streak milestone dialog at 7-day streak
- Test notification button in settings bottom sheet

### Fixed
- Repeat question back-to-back: questions already used in same day or same
  week are deprioritised when picking notification slots
